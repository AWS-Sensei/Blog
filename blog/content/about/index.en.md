## Hi and welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer with over **10 years of experience** in professional software engineering â€“ mainly working with **C#, Java and Python**. Over the years, Iâ€™ve written countless lines of code, but more importantly, Iâ€™ve learned that **good code isnâ€™t everything â€“ itâ€™s about the bigger picture**.

For the past **6 years**, Iâ€™ve been working extensively with **AWS**, building scalable, maintainable, and secure cloud solutions. Iâ€™ve deepened my expertise through hands-on projects and recently validated it with the **AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate** and **AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate** certifications.

A major turning point in my journey was discovering the principles of **DevOps**. Reading **"The Phoenix Project"** fundamentally changed the way I think about software delivery. Since then, Iâ€™ve been committed to bridging the gap between Dev, Ops, and Business â€“ driven by automation, transparency, and continuous improvement.

### What Iâ€™m passionate about:

- Clean Code & Test-Driven Development
- Automated CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud-native applications with AWS
- Infrastructure as Code (e.g., using Terraform or AWS CDK)
- Quality assurance with unit and integration tests
- Agile practices and DevOps culture

This blog is a place for me to share what Iâ€™ve learned, capture my thoughts, and hopefully help others along the way.
Whether you're just getting started or already deep in the code â€“ I'm glad you're here!

**Letâ€™s build better software. Together.**
